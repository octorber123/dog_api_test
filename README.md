## üìù Notes

- The code is commented throughout to explain assumptions or limitations.
- Since the external Dog API is rate-limited, introducing caching for those requests would help reduce unnecessary calls and improve performance.
- Additionally, API responses within this Laravel app could be cached to enhance efficiency and scalability in future optimizations.
